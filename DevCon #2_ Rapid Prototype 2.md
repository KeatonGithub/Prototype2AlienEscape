### **Objective Statement:**

**What are you trying to answer with this prototype?**

* This prototype explores how games can present fear and horror of the unknown to the player. It adheres to the following question: How does being chased by a giant UFO feel? It also shows how much environment and setting as well as sound design go a long way to make the player experience fear and horror.

### **Design Rationale:**

* **Experience Envisioned**: The goal of this design is to make the player experience a sense of fear and anxiety from being chased through a rundown terrain. It does this through the usage of visual, audio, and agility (as you need to be quick thinking in certain scenarios as your character is being chased).  
* **Innovative/Experimental Aspects**:  
  * *Environmental: Challenging aspects of the environment include geographical difficulty, jumping, and natural obstacles and dead ends that may block the player.*  
  * *Emotional Engagement: The level is decently dark and foggy creating a perfect environment for unease and fear within the player. The homemade humming sound grows as the UFO approaches closer to the player. Creating tension and anxiety as the risk of losing becomes clearer to the player.*  
  * *Innovative: The usage of making an invisible circle below the UFO that sends the player to the abducted screen; was innovative as making the actual UFO a child of it allowed the UFO to stay in the air and maintain its y position. It was also pretty innovative with the usage of the welding lens flare on the top of the light beam. Which allowed for the player to instantly recognise that the UFO was alive and powerful.*
